#Project 4 - Matrix Orthogonalization
#Develop a package that does a QR decomposition of a matrix using the orthogonal Householder transformation. You can find details of the algorithm here http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/class/cs6210-f09/lec18.pdf .
#Make a pip package out of it including dependencies. Add CI using Travis, testing installation from pip and running on a random matrix.
